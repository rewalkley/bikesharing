## OVERVIEW

The puprose of this analysis is to determine that, based on the bikesharing data in New York City, a similar program is feasible in Des Moines Iowa.

Below is an analysis of the results, along with visualizations and a link to the Tableau workbook.

## RESULTS

According to the data provided by Citi Bike, most riders of the bikes are males, and most trips are 20 minutes or less. Also, the majority of the rentals occur mid-morning and late afternoon, consistent with a normal 9-5 workday commute. Additionally, many of the trips begin and end in lower Manhattan, where many people live and work. This implies the majority of the riders of the bikes are using the service to get to and from work. From this, one can conclude that men are more willing to commute to work via bicycle than women.

The above analysis is reflected in the below visualization:

Further, the majority of rides appear to begin and end in Manhattan, as shown in the below visualizations:

## SUMMARY
From the data given, it appears the majority of users are males renting bikes to commute to/from work. Another visualization I would perform would be whether the bike pick up/drop off locations are near any significant tourist attractions or bus/metro terminals from outside of the city. If the locations tend to be near businesses and homes, one could further assume the use of bikes is mainly for local commuters.

For a bike program similar to New York's Citi Bike, I would want to know the following about Des Moines:
* How far would a typical commute be for a resident?
* How many men work in the downtown area?
* Are there any public transportation options that commuters might bicycle to/from during their commute?
