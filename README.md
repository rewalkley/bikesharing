## OVERVIEW

The puprose of this analysis is to determine that, based on the bikesharing data in New York City, a similar program is feasible in Des Moines Iowa.

Below is an analysis of the results, along with visualizations and a link to the Tableau workbook.

## RESULTS

According to the data provided by Citi Bike, most riders of the bikes are males, and most trips are 20 minutes or less. Also, the majority of the rentals occur mid-morning and late afternoon, consistent with a normal 9-5 workday commute. Additionally, many of the trips begin and end in lower Manhattan, where many businesses are located. This implies the majority of the riders of the bikes are using the service to get to and from work.
